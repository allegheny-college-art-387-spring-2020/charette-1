# ART 387: Impossible Architecture - Charette 1

## The Dérive

* Point value: 20 pts.
* Assigned: 13 January 2020
* Due: 20 January 2020

## Guiding Citations

> An architectural drawing is...spatial and material notations that can be decoded...in order to effect a transformation of reality at a distance from the author.
>
> Stan Allen, "Mapping the Unmappable (On Notation)"

> In other words, the experience of spatial life today is as much immaterial as it is physical, as much bound to time and relational connections as it is to traditional notions of enclosure and "place."

> James Corner, "The Agency of Mapping"

### Supporting readings

## Activity

Today, your team must go on a dérive which should last the duration of *1 hour*. This journey must have an "Operating Principle" which guarantees some level of randomness. Anyone in the group may take pictures or record the process, given that group members all approve of the media being created.

Before departing, you must designate individuals to occupy the following roles:

* Social Director/Conversationalist
* Director of Chronology/Timekeeper
* Keeper of Laws
* (Optional) Media Director

`The Social Director` is responisble for maintaining group conversation about the dérive or the `Guiding Citations` governing the activity.

`The Director of Chronology` must return the team to the classroom by the end of an hour’s time.

`The Keeper of Laws` enforces the "Operating Principle" the group chooses in order to randomize their experience. They must also enforce the edges of campus as boundaries, and other general rules which reinforce safety and sanity.

`The Media Director` collects and archives all media created by the team during their process.

At the end of this process, teams will collaborate on a representational form that accurately notates their experience.

### Developing your "Operating Principle"

Rather than giving you a prescriptive formula, here are some examples:

* Follow, at a long and comfortable distance as not to indicate that you're following someone at all, anyone wearing a red shirt. If anyone else with a red shirt enters your field of vision, you must now follow them.
* Flip a coin any time you come to an intersection. "Heads" means "go right"; "Tails": "go left."
* Look, you only have so much energy in a day to dedicate to this class. All you're going to do is take 1000 steps--no more no less.

## Deliverables

### (Un)map

* Due 20 January 2020 by the start of class (1:30 PM)

**Note**: If making a physical object, I require both the physical object and images of it placed in the appropriate directory.

#### Process

- [ ] A collaborative (un)map designed and organized in response to your teams' "Operating Principle" which:
    * acts as either a refutation or proof of the "Guiding Citations"
    * implements a "notational system" (read the Stan Allen reading for more guidance here) to describe the unfolding of time and/or space
        * This "notational system" must have a legend or key explaining how it works
- [ ] A written response which validates your team's position vis-a-vis your (un)map as proof or rebuttal
    * Place this response in the `writing` directory's `Response.md` file.

##### Nota bene

* This map may take any appropriate form keeping in mind that its presentation must occupy a duration of 5 minutes
* Keep in mind that the citations which guide this map are best informed by reading the sources from which they are taken

#### Media

* Pictures must be organized into a subdirectory of the `media` folder called `pictures`.
* Video must be must be placed in a subdirectory of the `media` folder called `videos`.
    * A catalog of all media (separated by folder/type) should appear in the `README.md` file located in the media folder.
* Sketches, drawings, notes, or other items generated as part of the activity should be placed in a folder titled `studies`.
    * If any material is included in the studies folder, include a README.md file in the folder with a catalog of all items contained.
* These files may use whatever naming convention your group sees fit to use

### Presentation

* Presented during class on 20 January 2020

This charette culminates in a 5-10 minute presentation which:

- [ ] Begins with a statement of the "Operating Principle" guiding the dérive
- [ ] Introduces members by name and role played during the process
- [ ] Displays and describes the final product of the activity, an appropriate form describing the process and outcome of the activity
- [ ] Describes the "notational system" used in organizing the final (un)map
- [ ] Uses _all_ media archived in this repository as part of the presentation
- [ ] Poses a question which contemplates both the (un)map and Stan Allen's idea of notation:

> Notations are necessarily reductive and abstract, yet the products of notation do not necessarily resemble the notation itself...notation also directs attention toward all of the intangible properties of the real that cannot be set down in graphic form.
>
> Stan Allen, "Mapping the Unmappable (On Notation)"

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness
- [ ] Use and explanation of a notation system
- [ ] Cogence of argument supporting final project outcome
- [ ] Documentation of process
